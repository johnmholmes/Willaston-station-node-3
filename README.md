# Willaston-station-node-Address-3 

This is my node for the Willaston station mimic panel

The mimic panel can be seen in this youtube channel video  https://youtu.be/dvoi87_vEuU 

It is running on a Arduino Mega which is connected to JMRI using a 6 meter usb cable and it is setup as a CMRI node address 10
